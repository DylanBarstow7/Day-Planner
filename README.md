# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Were creating a day planner that adapts to the current time of day.  The time boxes change color depending on the current time of day.  The current hour will be displayed in red.  "Available" time later in the day is displayed in green.  Time that has already gone by is shown in grey.  This planner allows you to write events into them, saving the information with the button to the right.
